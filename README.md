# Introduction to the Project

> The decoder is a way to endcode and decode messages. This project is designed to build tricky algorithms teaming up with Mocha and Chai.

# Project Setup

1. Download to your computer
1. `cd` into the folder
1. install dependencies locally by running the command `npm install`
1. to run the tests: `npm test`
1. to watch how the code you write affects the application website, you can run the following command. This command will start a server and take over your terminal window `npm start`. To stop the server, `Control+C`.

# Specs of each cipher

**Caesar shift** :

- is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order.

**Polybius square** :

- is a cipher that is achieved by arranging alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. For example, the letter `B` would be represented by the numerical pair `21`.

**Substitution cipher** :

- reqires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode the message.
